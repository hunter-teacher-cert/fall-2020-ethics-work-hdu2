1. Environment
I am not surprised that China is mentioned in the article https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20150402-the-worst-place-on-earth. Before moving to the United States, I remembered the pollution. My family and relatives frequently talked about one of the benefits of living in the U. S. was that it was cleaner. Most recently, in 2019, I attended a friendâ€™s wedding in Beijing. The place was so polluted that even on sunny days there was so much haze.
2. Digital Divide
It is difficult to learn and advance without the access to computers or internet. We are living in the digital age. In order to be competitive, we need reliable high speed internet and functional computers.
3. Security vs. Convenience
We need to think about how our data is tracked and utilized since we are always asked to agree to terms of use and privacy policy.
4. Bias

It is insane to be misidentified. In fact, it would be unacceptable if it were crime-related.
