Python
We recognize that this Python could be abstracted better. Next steps, pass the functions as an argument, create additional modules. Perhaps, even turn this into a flask page. We're just super proud that we were able to generate 170 districts.

kTs
Rosane, Margie, and I worked through all possible district shapes. The shapes in this pdf are the ones we reference in our methods.
